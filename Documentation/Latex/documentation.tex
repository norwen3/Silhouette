\subsection{Design Patterns}
\subsubsection{Builder Pattern}
We were very quickly guided towards using the Builder pattern when we first had decided on the Framework-type. The Builder pattern, unlike the Abstract Factory pattern, is a lot more like a "Fluent interface", meaning it relies heavily on method cascading.
The builder pattern is useful as it attempts to seperate the construction of an object from the way it is represented, this way we can use the same process to create many different looking objects that are fundementally similar.
We need to use the builder pattern when we want immutable objects. We want immutable classes because they have a wide range of benefits when we are developing an API. They are simple to use, they are synchronization safe, we only need one constructor, and they are great for maps(which we're using) to name a few.

The main problem with implementing the builder pattern is the sheer amount of extra code required. The lines will most likely more than double. However, those extra lines of code give us much more readable code and design flexibility. We exchange parameters in the constructor for much prettier method calls.

\subsection{Scenarios and Solutions}

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Make two rulesets, one that is a regular ruleset and one that is a grid ruleset. Give each ruleset a unique selector. For the regular ruleset, add a blue background and change the text color to \#32a852. For the grid, define three columns and two rows of varied size. Lastly, apply both of the rulesets to a Container of type "header".

\subsubsection{Scenario 1 - Proposed Solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    RuleSet color = new RuleSet(".color");
    color.addRule("background-color", "blue");
    color.addRule("color", Color.Hex(#32a852));

    Grid grid = new Grid("#grid");
    grid.setColumns("1fr", "100px", "2em");
    grid.setRows("50%", "120px");

    Container myHeader = new Container("header");
    myHeader.applySelector(".color");
    myHeader.applySelector("#grid");
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Make a table whose size changes dynamically, add values to the header row and add values to the rest of the rows as they are generated. Apply a class to the table and set a header color for the table.


\subsubsection{Scenario 2 - Proposed Solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    Table table = new Table();
    int col = headerArray.length;
    int row = array.length;
    RuleSet color = new RuleSet(".tableClass");
    color.addRule("background-color", Color.RGB(255,255,255));
    ColGroup headerCol = new ColGroup();

    table.setSize(row, col);
    table.applySelector(".tableClass");

    for(int i= 0; i<row; i++){
        for(int j= 0; j<col; j++){
            while(i<1){
                table.insertHead(i,j, headerArray[j]);
            }
            table.insertValue(i,j, array[j])
            if(i<1){
                headerCol.addCol(col, color.toString());
            }
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Make a frontpage and two article pages and share a common stylesheet between them. Add a simple ruleset that targets the body element and give it a lightgreen background to see that the changes have applied to all the pages. Lastly, generate the code.

\subsubsection{Scenario 3 - Proposed Solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    HTML myWebsite = new HTML("example website");
    
    Page frontPage = new Page("frontpage", "My Front Page");
    Page articlePage1 = new Page("article", "My First Article");
    page articlePage2 = new Page("article", "My Second Article");

    StyleSheet style = new StyleSheet("style.css");

    RuleSet bg = new RuleSet("body");
    bg.addRule("background-color", "lightgreen");

    style.append(bg);

    website.link("style.css");
    website.addPage(frontPage);
    website.addPage(articlePage1);
    website.addPage(articlePage2);

    website.initialize();
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
Make a simple form consisting of three input fields for username, password and submit. Label each of the fields accordingly and give the fieldset a legend of "Login Credentials".

\subsubsection{Scenario 4 - Proposed Solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    FieldSet myFields = new FieldSet();

    Input username = new Input("text");
    username.addLabel("Type Username");
    
    Input password = new Input("password");
    password.addLabel("Type Password");
    
    Input submit = new Input("submit");

    myFields.addFields(username, password, submit);
    myFields.addLegend("Login Credentials");
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
Make a Container of type header and give it a navigation bar with links to all pages previously created. Make the navigation bar into a CSS flexbox so that all anchors be laid horizontally and justify the content to be "space-around".

\subsubsection{Scenario 5 - Proposed Solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    Container header = new Container("header");
    Container nav = new Container("nav");

    Anchor link1 = new AnchorBuilder("Front Page", "frontpage.html").build();
    Anchor link2 = new AnchorBuilder("First Article", "article1.html").build();
    Anchor link3 = new AnchorBuilder("Second Article", "article1.html").build();

    nav.addElements(link1, link2, link3);

    FlexBox flexbox = new FlexBox("header nav");
    flexbox.setFlexDirection("row");
    flexbox.setJustifyContent("space-around");
\end{lstlisting}



    \subsubsection{HTML}

    Scenario 1: Make a form that looks like a CV, with a picture, some general text informasjon about my self as a person (wiht age, name etc.) wher the informasjon holder is in a strong text and the informasjon about the person is just normal text.

    Scenario 2: Youtube copie, make a area for a video to be stord on the page where the name of the video is over the video area and make is so that it can be seen form that webpage and not a like to another wabpage.

    Scenario 3: Login and password input area

    Scenario 4: Questionnaire -> Make a form wiht several questions using radio and/or chekbox (inputs)

    \subsubsection{CSS}

    Scenario 1: Nav-bar with link(s) button / box around it that are flexible (when it comes to the length and height of the webpage), and when hover over it will change the background color.
        
    Scenario 2: Make stationary background so when some one scroll on the webpage the containers will comes form the top or bottom depending what way they are scrolling and overlap the background.

    Scenario 3: Make a webpage that has diffrent colored boxes that are normaly 3 in length on a normal pc screen and just 1 in length when its used on a phone.
