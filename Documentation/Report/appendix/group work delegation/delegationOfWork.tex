\section{Lars Erik Faber}

    At the beginning of the semester I did a lot of research into different types of frameworks and helped brainstorming ideas to what kind of frameworks we could make together. Later on, I have been responsible for creating the CSS API and laid the ground works for the final report. I did one user test on my own with another person where we tested the whole framework. Finally I wrote the different sections in the final report relating to the CSS API, as well as the introduction, background, group description, Some parts relating to user testing in design process.
